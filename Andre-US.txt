As a buyer, I want to see price comparisons from other reputable sites such as Amazon, so I can see if the items on this platform are comparatively expensive.
As a seller, I want to specify the location where I sell my product, so I can reach different geographical audiences based on where I am.
As an advertiser, I want to be able to use text-based and video ads, so I can make advertising geared towards different user groups.
